## !!accordions Setup and initialize a new React project with NextUI

Before we dive into coding the profile page, let's set up our project:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and yarn (or npm) installed on your machine.
2.  **NextUI CLI:** Open your terminal and run the following command to install the NextUI CLI globally, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
yarn add nextui-cli -g
```

3.  **Init a new NextUI project :** Initialize a new NextUI project using the init command. This sets up your project with the necessary configurations:

```bash
nextui init my-nextui-app
```

You will be prompted to configure your project:
  
```bash
? Which components would you like to add? › - Space to select. Return to submit

Instructions:
    ↑/↓: Highlight option    
    ←/→/[space]: Toggle selection    
    [a,b,c]/delete: Filter choices    
    enter/return: Complete answer

Filtered results for: Enter something to filter
    ◯  accordion
    ◯  autocomplete
    ◯  avatar
    ◯  badge
    ◯  breadcrumbs◉  button
    ◯  card
    ◯  checkbox
    ◯  chip
    ◯  code
```

You can just use the default configuration and add all the components for now.

4.  **Start Development Server:** Install the dependencies to start the local server:

```bash
cd my-nextui-app && yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

You should now have a NextUI startup screen at `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, ready for us to transform into a stunning profile page!

## !!accordions Building the FeaturePhotos component

**Goal:** Craft a captivating header section showcasing a rotating carousel of feature photos using NextUI for styling, Embla Carousel React for the core carousel functionality, and Tailwind CSS for additional customization.

**Topics Covered:**

1.  **Component Structure and Props:** Set up the `FeaturePhotos` component to receive a `photos` prop (an array of image URLs) and a `showDots` prop (boolean) to control the display of navigation dots.
2.  **Image Display:** Use NextUI's `Image` component to render and style the photos within the carousel.
3.  **Embla Carousel Integration:** Seamlessly integrate Embla Carousel to create the sliding/rotating behavior.
4.  **Navigation Dots (Optional):** Implement the `showDots` prop to conditionally display navigation dots using NextUI components.
5.  **Styling and Customization:** Use Tailwind CSS classes and potentially NextUI styling to fine-tune the appearance and behavior of the carousel.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Key Points:**

*   The `photos` prop allows dynamic content, enabling reusability across different profile pages.
*   The `showDots` prop offers customization for visual preference or responsiveness.
*   Leverage Tailwind CSS's utility classes for efficient styling.

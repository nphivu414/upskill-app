## !!accordions Section 1: Setup and initialize a new React project with NextUI

Before we dive into coding the profile page, let's set up our project:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js, yarn (or npm) and git installed on your machine.
2.  **Clone our starter repo:** Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the starter repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/upskillsdev/starter-app.git
```

3.  **Start Development Server:** Install the dependencies to start the local server:

```bash
cd starter-app && yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

You should have a startup screen at `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser.
Now you can now head over to the `src/pages/index.tsx` file and start building the profile page.

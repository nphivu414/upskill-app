## !!accordions Section 1: Setup and initialize a new React project with NextUI

Before we dive into coding the profile page, let's set up our project:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js, yarn (or npm) and git installed on your machine.
2.  **Clone our starter repo:** Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the starter repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/upskillsdev/starter-app.git
```

3.  **Start Development Server:** Install the dependencies to start the local server:

```bash
cd starter-app && yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

You should have a startup screen at `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser.
Now you can now head over to the `src/pages/index.tsx` file and start building the search flight page.

## !!accordions Section 2: Building Flight Header Component

In this section, we will build the flight header component that displays the flight details and allows users to perform actions like going back and sharing the flight details.
The component will also support sticky behavior and hide on scroll so that it doesn't take up too much space on the screen.

1. Files and Structure:
   - `flight-header.tsx`: This file contains the flight header component.
   - `use-hide-on-scroll-header.ts`: This file contains the custom hook for hiding the header on scroll.
   - `typography.tsx`: This file contains the typography components for the flight header.
   - `utils.ts`: This file contains utility functions for formatting dates.
   - `constants.ts`: This file contains the constants for the flight header component like height and animation duration.
   - `types.ts`: This file contains the types for the flight header component.
